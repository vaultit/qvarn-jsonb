NEWS for Qvarn (JSONB)
=============================================================================

This file has release notes for Qvarn (the JSONB version).

Version 0.86, released 2017-10-10
----------------------------------

* All old API tests (`test-api`) pass. Qvarn (JSONB) is functionally
  complete now, and API compatible with the old Qvarn. It may not be
  performant enough yet.

Version 0.84, released 2017-09-27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is the first release of Qvarn (JSONB), and has been rewritten
  from scratch to use the Postgres JSONB data type for storing
  resources. It is NOT yet ready for production use. This release is
  done so we can test Ansible modifications, run benchmarks, and other
  such things.

  Do not use this release.
