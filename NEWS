NEWS for Qvarn (JSONB)
=============================================================================

This file has release notes for Qvarn (the JSONB version).

Version 0.89+git, not yet released
----------------------------------


Version 0.89, released 2017-12-14
----------------------------------

* Some fixes for `qvarn-dump` and the Qvarn backend for making
  `qvarn-copy` work better.

Version 0.88, released 2017-12-14
----------------------------------

* Fixed PUT of a subresource when done by `qvarn-copy` to not update
  the parent resource revision. This allows for a more exact copy to
  happen.

Version 0.87, released 2017-12-12
----------------------------------

New features:

* New utility `qvarn-copy` added. It copies resource between Qvarn
  instances.

* New utility `qvarn-dump` added. It extracts all resource from a
  Qvarn instance, in a form that can be diff'd to see a copy is
  complete.

* New utility `qvarn-stats` added. It counts resources in a Qvarn
  instance.

* An API client with the `set_meta_fields` scope is allowed to set the
  `id` and `revision` resources it creates. This is needed for
  `qvarn-copy`.

Bug fixes:

* Listeners for all resource types were listed for all resource types.
  Thus, `GET /foos/listners` would list listeners also for `bar`
  resources, not just `foo`. This has been fixed. Bug reported by
  Kaius, fixed by Lars.

* Mantas reported that if a resource type or resource had two fields
  with the same type but values that were not possible to compare,
  such as a string and an integer, Qvarn would crash. This is now
  fixed.

* Saulius Å½emaitaitis reported that updating a resource type
  specification YAML file and restarting Qvarn wouldn't make the new
  version of the resource type availables. Fixed now.

Version 0.86, released 2017-10-10
----------------------------------

* All old API tests (`test-api`) pass. Qvarn (JSONB) is functionally
  complete now, and API compatible with the old Qvarn. It may not be
  performant enough yet.

Version 0.84, released 2017-09-27
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* This is the first release of Qvarn (JSONB), and has been rewritten
  from scratch to use the Postgres JSONB data type for storing
  resources. It is NOT yet ready for production use. This release is
  done so we can test Ansible modifications, run benchmarks, and other
  such things.

  Do not use this release.
