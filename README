History and background
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qvarn started as an internal project in 2015 at Suomen Tilaajavastuu
(https://www.tilaajavastuu.fi/en/), a company that provides various
reproting services to the Finnish construction industry. Later that
year the Swedish Construction Federation
(https://www.sverigesbyggindustrier.se/english) adopted Qvarn as a
platform for ID06 identity card services in Sweden. From the start, a
goal for Qvarn has been to make it easy to comply with the EU General
Data Protection Regulation.

In 2016 Qvarn spun off to its own company, QvarnLabs Ab, which
provides consulting, development, and support services around Qvarn.
