# This program builds Qvarn and installs it on the host given on the
# command line as an upgrade. The host must already have been
# configured to run Qvarn. This script does nothing to update
# configuration files, for example.
#
# This script is meant to be used while developing Qvarn: make
# changes, commit them, build, deploy to a server, and then test the
# server.
#
# Usage:
#
#    $0 HOST BOOL
#
# where HOST is the address of the server on which to upgrade Qvarn,
# and BOOL is "true" to indicate the databases should be emptied
# (recreated), and log files deleted, and "false" if not.
#
# Note that changes must be committed to git before running this
# script, and you must be able to ssh into the server and run sudo
# there.
